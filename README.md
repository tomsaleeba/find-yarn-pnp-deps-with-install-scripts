# What is it?
A tool for yarn/npm projects that searches your dependencies and tells you which ones
declare some sort of install script. It supports both:
- Yarn Plug'n'Play dependencies (`.yarn/cache/*.zip`)
- Standard `node_modules` dependencies

Install scripts are dangerous; you should disable them! But that might break the
functionality of some packages, and this tool lets you know *which* packages, so you can
figure out workarounds.

The workarounds might be letting scripts run just for those packages, manually running the commands that would've run or something else.

# How to use it
You do not need to install it into your project. You can run it with:

```bash
npx https://github.com/tomsaleeba/find-yarn-pnp-deps-with-install-scripts
```

...and it will print progress to stderr, and results to stdout. So you probably want to
run with something like:
```bash
# cd to your project dir that has the .yarn/ or node_modules/ directory in it
cd my-project/
npx https://github.com/tomsaleeba/find-yarn-pnp-deps-with-install-scripts | tee results.txt
```

...and then you can watch the progress (it should take less than a minute for a normal
amount of dependencies on a regular laptop) and have a copy of the results in `results.txt`.

The tool will automatically detect and scan:
- `.yarn/cache/` if it exists (Yarn PnP) - preferred
- `node_modules/` if Yarn PnP cache is not found (npm/yarn classic/pnpm)

Example output (Yarn PnP):
```
$ npx https://github.com/tomsaleeba/find-yarn-pnp-deps-with-install-scripts | tee results.txt

I had hoped it would work with `yarn dlx` too, but it doesn't:
```bash
$ yarn dlx https://github.com/tomsaleeba/find-yarn-pnp-deps-with-install-scripts
